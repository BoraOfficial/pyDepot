<b>pyDepot</b> is a lightweight <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network-attached_storage">Network-attached storage</a> manager.
<br>
Basically, it's a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_storage">Cloud Storage</a> that you host yourself!

## So what are the advantages?
Well, one of the biggest advantages is that it's 100% private, you don't have to take my word for it though, go through the code yourself!

Also, there isn't a "Storage Limit". You can upload as many files as you like if you have enough space!

# How do I use it?
First you need to have <a href="https://python.org">Python</a> installed.

Then simply click the <b>Code</b> button and download as a zip and extract it.

After that you're going to install the dependencies using this command:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

After it's installed, you're ready to run it using this command:

```
python server.py
```
---

Now, your very own Cloud Storage is running. Check it out by going to this URL:

```
127.0.0.1:5000
```


If you want, you can also install something like <a href="https://ngrok.com">Ngrok</a> to access your Cloud Storage across the network!
